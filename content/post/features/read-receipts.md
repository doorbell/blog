A feature almost all CRMs have is email read receipts. Even though Doorbell is not a CRM, it can certainly be helpful to know if the messages you sent have been read or not.

As of today, Doorbell has read receipts.

As you can see in the image above, you will now see a little icon next to each message sent by your any of your team members, which will indicate if the person who originally submitted the message has seen your message (or not).
