As a company grows, managing the team's access across all software vendors becomes tiresome.

It's easy to forget to revoke access of team members who leave, or separately inviting each new person to several different platforms.

Luckily these problems are easily resolved by Single Sign On (SSO), and now Doorbell supports SSO using the SAML 2.0 protocol.

<!--more-->

We've designed our platform to work with SAML 2.0 and tested against a variety of IDPs such as [Okta](https://www.okta.com). But any standards-compliant SAML 2.0 implementation should work out of the box.

SSO is available on the [Enterprise plan](https://doorbell.io/pricing?ref=blog-sso), but you can try it out for free on our 7 day trial!

Go ahead, give it a try! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io)!
