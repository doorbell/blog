Since Doorbell first went live, one of the most frequently requested features has been allowing anonymous feedback.

We can of course see why (not all users want to share their email address), but it obviously has some major implications to the flow of things (you can't reply to the feedback, for example).

We've been beta testing this feature for a while, and we're very proud to say that we've just released it to everybody!

## How do I enable it?
   
If you go to your applications's setup page, you'll find a new section under **General Settings** > **Settings**. It is (unsurprisingly) called **Anonymous feedback**.

To allow anonymous feedback, simply select the checkbox, and click the Save button!

## What changes if I enable it?

Well, the main difference is that you won't be able to reply to the feedback thread if the user didn't submit an address. No way around that unfortunately, sorry!

If you do enable it, you might want to change the label/placeholder of the email field to indicate that it is optional, up to you!

## Finally

We'd just like to thank our beta testers once again for patiently trying out the feature and giving us invaluable feedback in the process!

Go ahead, give it a whirl! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io), it's free!
