No matter how good your FAQ might be, and how clear your site is, there is still a high chance that you'll keep getting the same questions coming in over and over again.

To make life easier, Doorbell now has canned responses!

As you can see in the image above, you will now see a new dropdown when replying which has a list of your canned responses. You can easily select one, prepopulate the message of your reply, and customise it (if you need to) before sending it.

So go ahead and try it out, it is available on the [Business plan](https://doorbell.io/pricing?ref=blog-read-receipts), but you can try it out for free for 15 days!

Go ahead, give it a whirl! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io), it's free!

PS You can keep up to date either via this blog, or you can follow Doorbell on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/doorbell_io).
