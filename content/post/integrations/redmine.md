Our latest project management integration is now live: [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org)!

Setting up your Redmine integration is very simple! Head over to your [integrations page](https://doorbell.io/integrations#redmine), and enter your Redmine URL (for example: http://redmine.example.com) and your API key (You can find your API key on your account page ( /my/account ) when logged in, on the right-hand pane of the default layout).

Once that's done, you can start creating issues in your projects!

By going the feedback thread you want to send to Redmine, you'll see that the “Send to…” button now has a new option:

Clicking that, opens the form so you can select the project you want, and type in a title for the issue:

Once you enter your title, you'll see a note that the issue was created on Redmine:

The description is already prepopulated for you with the original message from the user.

If you're not yet using Redmine but would like to try it out, you can go sign up for a hosted Redmine by [Plan.io](https://plan.io)! (a great service I used for testing while setting up the integration)

Also a huge shout out to [Ezequiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekupelian) from [Lyracons](http://www.lyracons.com) (a software development company focused on open source eCommerce implementations. Vast expertise in complex, large-scale, B2C & B2B projects) for his invaluable help testing and debugging the integration!
