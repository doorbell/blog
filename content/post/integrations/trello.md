After our first 4 integrations (Sprint.ly, GitHub, FogBugz and Asana), we finally managed to integrate [Trello](https://trello.com/). Which is a great thing, since we use Trello ourselves to organize Doorbell!

Setting up the Trello integration is dead simple, and only requires about 2 clicks. Head over to your [integrations page](https://doorbell.io/integrations#trello), and click the "Connect Trello" button. It will redirect you to Trello, when you need to authorize Doorbell to access your boards.

Once that's done, you can start sending your user feedback to your boards!

By going the feedback thread you want to send to Trello, you'll see that the "Send to..." button now has a Trello option:

Clicking that, opens the form so you can select the board/list you want, and type in a name for the card:

Once you enter your title (will be used as the card name), you'll see a note that the card was created on Trello:

The description is already prepopulated for you with the original message from the user. Nicely formatted in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) of course!

Go ahead, give it a whirl! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io), it's free!
