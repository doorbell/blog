We've got a new category of integration to announce today: session recordings! Doorbell might not provide session recording by itself, but that's not a problem with you can build an awesome integration with other tools that do it really well!

<!--more-->

We're really excited to announce that Doorbell now integrates with 4 platforms that provide session recording:

* [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com)
* [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com)
* [SessionStack](https://www.sessionstack.com)
* [SmartLook](https://www.smartlook.com)

The integration works by detecting that you have one of the above services installed and enabled on your website, and Doorbell can capture the current recording details.

Doorbell will save a link to the recording of the current session, so you can easily see what the user had done before sending you a message through Doorbell.
