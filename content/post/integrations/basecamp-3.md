Doorbell at the moment has 20 integrations with [Project Management systems](https://doorbell.io/integrations), and we're really excited our 20 Â½ (?!?) integration: Basecamp 3.

<!--more-->

Doorbell has had a Basecamp 2 integration for a while now, but it is about time we get all caught up with the latest version of Basecamp.

Not to worry, Basecamp 2 is still fully supported and that's not going away anytime soon. This is just adding support for the new version. 

### Setup

Setting up your Basecamp integration is very simple! Head over to the [integrations page](https://doorbell.io/integrations#basecamp), and click the "Connect Basecamp" button.

You'll then be redirected to Basecamp, to select your account, and authorize Doorbell to access it (in order to create discussions/to-dos).

### Using the integration

When you open a conversation on Doorbell, you'll see that the "Send to..." button (in the right sidebar) now has a Basecamp option:

Clicking that, opens the form so you can select the project, type (discussion or to-do) and title you want:

Once you create the message or to-do in Basecamp, you'll see a note on Doorbell confirming it:

The description is already pre-populated for you with the original message from the user.

Go ahead, give it a try! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io/?ref=basecamp-blog), it's free!

P.S. You can keep up to date either via this blog, or you can follow Doorbell on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/doorbell_io).
