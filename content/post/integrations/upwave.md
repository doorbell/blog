Our new integration has just landed: [UpWave](https://www.upwave.io)! Doorbell already has integrations with many popular project management systems, but we can't only be catering to the big project management systems.

<!--more-->

Setting up your UpWave integration is very simple! Head over to the [integrations page](https://doorbell.io/integrations#upwave), and enter your API key and your UpWave URL. For example, if your UpWave URL was http://doorbell.upwave.io, you would just enter doorbell in the textbox.

Once that's done, you can start sending user feedback to your boards!

By going the feedback thread you want to send to UpWave, you'll see that the "Send to..." button now has a UpWave option:

Clicking that, opens the form so you can select the board and column you want, and type in a name for the card:

Once you create the card in UpWave, you'll see a note on Doorbell confirming it:

The description is already pre-populated for you with the original message from the user.

Go ahead, give it a try! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io/?ref=upwave-blog), it's free!
