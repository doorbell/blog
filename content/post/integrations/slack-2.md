Over the past months, the fine folks at [Slack](https://slack.com) have been hard at work making it easier for applications to create integrations.

With the availability of the [Slack button](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button), it makes it far easier to add the Slack integration compared to [the old way]({{< ref "post/integrations/slack.md" >}})!

## Setup

To setup the integration, head over to [Doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io), open your application's setup page. Then go to the **Notifications** > **Group Chat Notifications**. Now all you need to do is expand the **Slack** option, and click the **Add to Slack** button!

This will take you over to Slack, where you can configure the integration, and select which channel you want to receive messages in.

After that you'll be taken back to Doorbell, and the integration will be all setup! No more copying and pasting URLs!

Go ahead, give it a try! If you haven't got an account yet, go sign up now: [https://doorbell.io](https://doorbell.io)!
