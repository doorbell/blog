Our latest project management integration is now live: [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com), by [entp](http://entp.com)!

Setting up your Lighthouse integration is very simple! Head over to your [integrations page](https://doorbell.io/integrations#lighthouse), and enter your [API key](http://help.lighthouseapp.com/kb/api/how-do-i-get-an-api-token) and your Lighthouse URL. For example, if your Lighthouse URL was http://doorbell-io.lighthouseapp.com, you would just enter **doorbell-io** in the textbox.

Once that's done, you can start creating tickets with your user feedback in the Lighthouse projects!

By going the feedback thread you want to send to Lighthouse, you'll see that the "Send to..." button now has a new option:

![](/img/integrations/lighthouse/send-to.png)

Clicking that, opens the form so you can select the project you want, and type in a name for the ticket:

Once you enter your title, you'll see a note that the ticket was created on Lighthouse:

The description is already prepopulated for you with the original message from the user. Nicely formatted in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) of course!
