Our latest project management integration is now live: [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)!

Setting up your BitBucket integration is very simple thanks to OAuth! Head over to your [integrations page](https://doorbell.io/integrations#bitbucket), and click on the "Connect BitBucket" button.

Once that's done, you can start creating issues in the repositories where you've enabled them! (You can find instructions on how to enable issue on your repos at the following link: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Enable+an+issue+tracker)

By going the feedback thread you want to send to BitBucket, you'll see that the "Send toâ€¦" button now has a new option:

Clicking that, opens the form so you can select the repository you want, and type in a name for the issue:

Once you enter your title, you'll see a note that the issue was created on BitBucket:

The description is already prepopulated for you with the original message from the user. Nicely formatted in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) of course!
